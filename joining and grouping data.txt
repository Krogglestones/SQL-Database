Joining and Grouping Data

1)  Perform an inner join on Players and Managers on PlayerID.   Include all fields in Players and all fields in Managers but PlayerID on PlayerID.  How many records are there?  Look over the data.  Change the join to a left join.  Look over the data results. How many records are there?  What is the difference?  Change the join back to an inner join.  
	Inner Join:  3404 rows
	Left Outer Join:  21555 rows
	The difference is that the inner join only includes players who also managed while the left outer join included all players regardless of whether they’ve ever managed.
	SELECT Players.*, Managers.*
	FROM Players INNER JOIN
	Managers ON Players.playerIDpk = Managers.playerID

2)  Save the view as vwPlayerManagers.  With an inner join we will get only parents (players) with children (managers) – in other words, only managers.  Text the view 
	create view vwPlayersManagers as
	SELECT Players.*, Managers.*
	FROM Players INNER JOIN
	Managers ON Players.playerIDpk = Managers.playerID

3)  Develop a SELECT to show each manager’s name, team and the number of games they managed that team overall. 
	select nameLast LastName, nameFirst FirstName, teamID Team, sum(g) TotalGames
	from vwPlayersManagers
	group by nameLast, nameFirst, teamID
	having sum(g) > 0

4)  Provide the manager name, total wins and total losses for only managers with an overall winning record (total wins > total losses) 
	select nameLast LastName, nameFirst FirstName, sum(w) TotalWins, sum(l) TotalLosses
	from vwPlayersManagers
	where w > l
	group by nameLast, nameFirst
	order by nameLast

5)  In a single SELECT, which manager has the greatest number of wins? 
	Connie Mack
	
	select players.playeridpk, players.namefirst,players.namelast,HiWins.TotalWins
	from Players inner join (select playerid, sum(w) TotalWins from managers
	group by playerID
	having sum(w)=(select max(totalwins) GreatestWins from (
	select playerid, sum(w) TotalWins from Managers
	group by playerid) totalmgrwins))
	HiWins on players.playerIDpk=HiWins.playerID

6)  Write a SELECT to compare Wins of players that were also manager versus those that were never managers (you can use either the plyMgr or bPlyMger fields).  Does player experience seem to matter once you become a manager?  (5)
	It does not matter.  The results show managers that didn’t play have about 14 more wins a year, on average.
	select avg(w * 1.0) nonPlayers
	from vwPlayersManagers
	where plyrMgr = 'n'
	select avg(w * 1.0) playerManagers
	from vwPlayersManagers
	where plyrMgr = 'y'

7)  Who managed a single team the most seasons?  Provide a single SELECT to demonstrate. 
	Connie Mack
	select nameFirst 'First', nameLast 'Last', sum(g) TotalGames, teamID
	from vwPlayersManagers
	group by nameFirst, nameLast, teamID
	having sum(g) >1
	order by sum(g) desc

8)  Who managed overall the most?  Provide a single SELECT to demonstrate. 
	Connie Mack
	select nameFirst 'First', nameLast 'Last', sum(g) TotalGames
	from vwPlayersManagers
	group by nameFirst, nameLast
	having sum(g) >1
	order by sum(g) desc

9)  Which team had the most managers? 
	Chicago Cubs
	select teamid Team, count(distinct playeridpk) '# of Managers'
	from vwPlayersManagers
	group by teamID
	having count(distinct playeridpk) > 0
	order by count(distinct playeridpk) desc

10)  Who was the shortest manager? 
	Dickey Pierce and Cub Stricker – 63 inches
	select height, namelast, namefirst
	from vwPlayersManagers
	where height = (select min(height) from vwPlayersManagers)
	group by nameLast, nameFirst, height

11)  How many managers were foreign born? 
	46
	select count(distinct playerIDpk) ForeignBornManagers
	from vwPlayersManagers
	where birthCountry != 'usa'

12)  Inner Join Players to Batting.  Create a view vwPlayerBatting. 
	create view vwPlayersBatting as
	SELECT Players.*, Batting.*
	FROM Players INNER JOIN
	Batting ON Players.playerIDpk = Batting.playerID

13)  Who hit the most home runs in history (single SELECT statement) 
	Barry Bonds *
	select nameLast LastName, nameFirst FirstName, sum(hr) TotalHomers
	from vwPlayersBatting
	group by playerIDpk, nameLast, nameFirst
	having sum(hr) >0
	order by sum(hr) desc

14)  Provide a SELECT listing the most consistent home run hitters (average) that played (having) in at least 20 games in a season. 
	select (sum (ab * 1.0)) / (sum (hr * 1.0)) AtBatPerHomer, namelast LastName, nameFirst Firstname
	from vwPlayersBatting
	where hr >0 
	group by nameLast, nameFirst,playerIDpk,g
	having g >= 20
	order by (sum (ab * 1.0)) / (sum (hr * 1.0)) asc

15)  Who had the most triples (B3) in history (single SELECT statement). 
	Sam Crawford
	select namelast, namefirst, sum(b3) Triples
	from vwPlayersBatting
	group by nameLast, nameFirst
	having sum(b3) > 0
	order by sum(b3) desc
