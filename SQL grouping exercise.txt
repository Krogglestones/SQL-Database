SQL Grouping Exercise

1.	Total lifetime batting history (all batting table data) for all players returned in player name order (hint: simple SELECT from view). 

	select * from vwPlayersBatting

2.	Hall of fame homerun hitters that hit 500 or more homeruns in their life.  Include their name and number of home runs.  Because there might be duplicate names, I suggest you group by playerID and name.

	select playeridpk ID, namelast LastName, nameFirst FirstName, sum(hr) Homers
	from vwPlayersBatting
	group by playerIDpk, nameLast, nameFirst
	having sum(hr) >= 500

3.	As long as we are at it (previous question), how many and which players have the same first and last names?   For example:

You will need only the Players table. Exclude unique names â€“ include only those with 2 or more matches (Having)

	select  namelast LastName, nameFirst FirstName, count(namelast) '# ofThem'
	from Players
	group by nameLast, nameFirst
	having (count(nameLast) >=2) and (count(namefirst) >=2)
	order by nameLast

4.	The average player weight and height by teams during the year 1987.

	select teamid team, avg(weight) AverageWeight, avg(height) AverageHeight
	from vwPlayersBatting
	where yearID = 1987
	group by teamID
	order by teamID

5.	What are the top 5 Teams with the greatest average weight (display the team and weight).  TOP is acceptable here.

	select top 5 avg(weight) AvgWeight, teamid
	from vwPlayersBatting
	group by teamid
	order by AvgWeight desc

6.	Compare the average weight and height of the Mariners (SEA) for each year they played.  Include the year, average weight and average height in year order.

	select yearid 'Year', avg(weight) AvgWeight, avg(height) AvgHeight
	from vwPlayersBatting
	where teamID = 'sea'
	group by yearID
	order by yearID desc

7.	Compare the total homeruns hit by year for all teams in team then year order

	select teamid Team, yearID 'Year', sum(hr) Homers 
	from vwPlayersBatting
	group by teamID, yearID
	order by teamID, yearID desc

8.	Which (if any) current batters (no finale) that weigh less than 180 pounds, hit more than 20 home runs in any given year.  Return the name and number of home runs ordered by the most homeruns to the least.

	select yearID, nameFirst 'First', nameLast 'Last', sum(hr) Homers
	from vwPlayersBatting
	where (hr > 20) and (weight < 180) and (finalGameDate >= '2015-10-04')
	group by yearID, nameFirst, nameLast, hr
	order by hr desc
